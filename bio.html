      <h1>So you wanna know who I am?</h1>
      <h2>Why am I doing this?</h2>
      <p>I am doing this solely for the purpose of educating myself in coding and graphic design more. My goal is to learn new skills as I go along and turn it into a career oppurtunity.
      I do have an Associates in business managent but my real joy I recently found has to do with computing.</p>
